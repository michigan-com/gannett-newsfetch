The buoy was damaged and large chunks of concrete fell into the roadway.\n\nJocelyn Hall, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Transportation, said the damage to the bridge appears to be cosmetic and not structural. However, she said, MDOT inspectors are still assessing the damage.\nThe truck and buoy were removed shortly after the incident.\nCitations will be issued, Nowiski said.","created_at":"2016-05-26T18:08:00.753Z","headline":"Truck hauling buoy damages Blue Water Bridge","photo":{"caption":"A truck carrying a buoy struck and was dragged under the Blue Water Bridge at Pine Grove Ave Thursday, May 26 in Port Huron.","credit":"Beth LeBlanc, Times Herald","full":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":3264,"height":1572},"thumbnail":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8d0944b6e6044490d311ee5c86f0c621a3b0d82c/c=771-0-2603-1566/local/-/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":1832,"height":1566},"small":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/536fb06040edded80ea8f4713138c0094dfdb118/r=500x240/local/-/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":500,"height":240},"crops":{"1_1":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/54c42fda4ab80dbc70911efe5fbb06896f713799/c=1118-0-2684-1566/local/-/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":1566,"height":1566},"4_3":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9fcd79d6f406a62e624015588395df78ec5bbb58/c=528-0-2611-1566/local/-/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":2083,"height":1566},"3_4":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ab5b65c78c2aa1e799db4c611de50785d7579eef/c=1300-0-2474-1566/local/-/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":1174,"height":1566},"16_9":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/efdbee5bd06c9791a243851e5534695f55ad8034/c=109-0-2881-1566/local/-/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":2772,"height":1566},"9_16":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7104be1fc6d18c6e8d7d05da78adb2c34b8560dc/c=1824-0-2701-1566/local/-/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":877,"height":1566},"front_thumb":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8d0944b6e6044490d311ee5c86f0c621a3b0d82c/c=771-0-2603-1566/local/-/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":1832,"height":1566},"small":{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/536fb06040edded80ea8f4713138c0094dfdb118/r=500x240/local/-/media/2016/05/26/MIGroup/PortHuron/635998524283683957-IMG-4465.JPG","width":500,"height":240}}},"section":"news","sections":["news","local","michigan"],"source":"freep","storyHighlights":[],"subheadline":"The Michigan Department of Transportation said the damage to the bridge appears to be cosmetic and not structural.","subsection":"local","summary":["\n\nA semi-truck hauling a large buoy caused damage to the Blue Water Bridge while passing under the structure Thursday morning.","The incident happened shortly before 9 a.m. when a semi hauling a buoy attempted to pass under the Blue Water Bridge while traveling north on Pine Grove Avenue in Port Huron, according to St. Clair County Sheriff Deputy Russ Nowiski.","The buoy it was carrying dragged across the understructure of the bridge before it became stuck on the north side."],"timestamp":"2016-05-26T18:08:00.753Z","updated_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","url":"http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/05/26/truck-hauling-buoy-damages-blue-water-bridge/84982356/"}
